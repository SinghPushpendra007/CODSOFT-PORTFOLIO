Personal Portfolio Website Created by PUSHPENDRA SINGH This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

The primary goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and fully responsive portfolio that highlights my skills, Qualification. The website serves as a professional portfolio for potential employers, collaborators, or clients to understand my capabilities and get in touch with me effortlessly.

Additionally, this project allowed me to refine my front-end development skills, implement modern web design principles, and explore responsive layouts and interactivity.

1. HTML5 Provides the structural foundation of the website. Utilizes semantic elements for better readability and SEO optimization.
2. CSS3 Responsible for the websiteâ€™s styling, including color schemes, typography, and layout management. Implements media queries to ensure responsiveness.
3. JavaScript Adds functionality and interactivity to the website. Handles dynamic behavior like menu toggles, form validation, and animations.

By working on real-world tasks, I gained insights into the workflow of web development projects, the importance of meeting deadlines, and maintaining high-quality standards.
